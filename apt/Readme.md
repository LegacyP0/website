# iOS Legacy Tweaks Repository

Originally created to fix WeeLoaderPreference for using Lockinfo on iOS 6, this repository now also includes important and hard-to-find tweaks from the iOS 3/4/5/6 era. Sometimes these tweaks come from pirate sources, but it is impossible to pay for them today as the developers have either disappeared or no longer respond to requests. Thanks, ModMyi!

## Included Tweaks

- **WeeLoaderPreference**: Fixed for compatibility with Lockinfo on iOS 6.
- **Legacy Tweaks**: A collection of tweaks that were popular during the iOS 3/4/5/6 eras. 

## Disclaimer

Some tweaks may have originally come from sources that are no longer available. The aim is to preserve these tweaks for use on older devices, ensuring they remain functional for enthusiasts and collectors.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have any tweaks or fixes for legacy iOS versions that you'd like to share, please submit a pull request or open an issue.
